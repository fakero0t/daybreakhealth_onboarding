I pride myself on being a non-judgmental and reliable individual, committed to fostering positive interactions with those I serve. Outside of my professional endeavors, I cherish moments spent with my husband and three teenagers, engaging in activities like movie nights, traveling, exercising, attending their various sports events (football, basketball, baseball, and cheerleading), and sharing lively dance sessions in our kitchen. Our beloved dog, Coco, is always right in the midst of our family adventures, adding an extra touch of joy to our lives."", ""npi"": ""1013770668"", ""type"": ""Associate Clinician"", ""email"": ""monishabrewer@daybreakhealth.com"", ""phone"": ""310-345-9482"", ""gender"": ""Female"", ""status"": ""Active"", ""user_id"": ""bbd3d8e4-04d7-4d3c-b7c7-2baff5235433"", ""religion"": ""Christian"", ""ethnicity"": ""Black or African American / African Descendant;Multiracial"", ""full_name"": ""Monisha Brewer"", ""languages"": [""English""], ""healthie_id"": ""9636549"", ""_fivetran_id"": ""502126f86048aef2baa53bae063ecce6"", ""created_date"": ""2024-02-05T16:48:17.000+00:00"", ""state_primary"": ""California"", ""states_active"": ""California"", ""supervisor_id"": ""a1GRP000002CkcH2AS"", ""total_capacity"": 15.0, ""employment_type"": ""W2 Employee - Dedicated Capacity"", ""ethnicity_other"": null, ""supervisor_name"": ""Marissa Vellichor"", ""supervisor_type"": ""Clinician"", ""_fivetran_synced"": ""2025-11-06T18:58:43.132+00:00"", ""_fivetran_deleted"": false, ""salesforce_user_id"": ""005RP000002W4FRYA0"", ""sexual_orientation"": ""Heterosexual or straight"", ""health_plans_active"": ""ALAMEDA ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH, ANTHEM BC CALIFORNIA, Aetna, Aetna - California, Alameda Alliance, Alameda Alliance - Medicaid, Anthem Blue Cross CA, Anthem Blue Cross California, Anthem Blue Cross Partnership Plan, Anthem Blue Cross- California, BS CALIFORNIA + FED, Beacon, Beacon/Carelon, Blue Shield California, Blue Shield of CA, CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH (CCAH), Carelon, Carelon - Commercial, Carelon - Medicaid, Central California Alliance for Health, Cigna - California, Cigna California, Cigna of CA, INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN, Inland Empire Health Plan, Inland Empire Health Plan (IEHP), Inland Empire Health Plan - Medicaid, MEDI-CAL, Medi-Cal, United CA, United Healthcare - California, United Healthcare - California- Commercial, United Healthcare - California2"", ""oasis_migration_flag"": true, ""capacity_total_kaiser"": 0.0, ""salesforce_account_id"": ""001RP000007MJsnYAG"", ""supervisor_account_id"": ""0014W00002aqybAQAQ"", ""capacity_filled_kaiser"": 0.0, ""health_plan_ids_active"": ""a2q4W0000006puYQAQ, a2q4W0000006puYQAQ, a2qRP000002IXXRYA4, a2qRP000002IXXRYA4, a2q4W0000006puXQAQ, a2q4W0000006puXQAQ, a2q4W0000006puXQAQ, a2q4W0000006puXQAQ, a2qRP000002qfNiYAI, a2q4W000002ClvHQAS, a2q4W000002ClvHQAS, a2q4W000002ClvHQAS, a2q4W000002ClvHQAS, a2qRP000000kzwXYAQ, a2qRP000000kzwXYAQ, a2qRP000000kzwXYAQ, a2qRP0000055vXRYAY, a2qRP0000055vXRYAY, a2q4W0000006gmZQAQ, a2q4W0000006gmZQAQ, a2q4W0000006gmZQAQ, a2q4W0000006gmZQAQ, a2q4W0000006gm5QAA, a2q4W0000006gm5QAA, a2q4W0000006gm5QAA, a2q4W0000006gpOQAQ, a2q4W0000006gpOQAQ, a2q4W0000006gpOQAQ, a2q4W0000006nJfQAI, a2q4W0000006nJfQAI, a2q4W0000006nJfQAI, a2q4W0000006nJfQAI, a2qRP000002fv61YAA"", ""associate_supervisor_id"": ""a1GRP000002CjQ22AK"", ""capacity_total_daybreak"": 15.0, ""salesforce_clinician_id"": ""a1GRP000002ClTR2A0"", ""capacity_available_total"": 7.0, ""capacity_filled_daybreak"": 8.0, ""clinical_programs_active"": ""Insurance - Cost-Sharing, Insurance - Medicaid, Insurance Commercial, SVMC Sponsored, School Sponsored, Self Pay"", ""sexual_orientation_other"": null, ""associate_supervisor_name"": ""Cassandra Chambers"", ""capacity_available_kaiser"": 0.0, ""capacity_available_daybreak"": 7.0, ""associate_supervisor_account_id"": ""0014W00002ec6j5QAA""}",[],2025-08-13T22:14:23.269046,2025-11-07T20:13:25.703469,eab0386e-cfa4-473c-9199-a9317c94d8fc,false,2025-11-07 20:37:57.034 UTC,0,3,15,[],15,0,1,[],"[""Black or African American / African Descendant"",""Multiracial""]",[],1,2,,,8,7,0,"[""Christian""]",8,CA,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One method I use is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. CBT helps you develop practical skills to manage your symptoms and improve your overall well-being. I also incorporate Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is effective for managing intense emotions and improving interpersonal relationships. DBT teaches skills for emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and effective communication. Reducing stigma around mental health, sexuality, and gender is crucial to my work. I aim to create a supportive environment where everyone feels comfortable discussing these topics openly and without judgment. Outside of work, I find joy in singing and spending time at the beach.

I hail from Champaign, IL and moved to Chicago for college and grad school and have continued to live and work in this city I have grown to love so dearly. I identify as a neurodivergent therapist after receiving my ADHD diagnosis at 26, inspiring my own self discovery journey and my work with neurodiverse clients. My hobbies included fiber arts, reading, and tending to my plants and beloved  pet cats."", ""npi"": ""1982326427"", ""type"": ""Associate Clinician"", ""email"": ""raventayborn@daybreakhealth.com"", ""phone"": ""(217) 766-7467"", ""gender"": ""Female"", ""status"": ""Inactive"", ""user_id"": ""98a01210-d609-42da-9877-8499c493e0d7"", ""religion"": ""Unaffiliated"", ""ethnicity"": ""Black or African American / African Descendant"", ""full_name"": ""Raven Tayborn"", ""languages"": [""English""], ""healthie_id"": ""9636958"", ""_fivetran_id"": ""5fc300ae0770809a737a0a103c801789"", ""created_date"": ""2024-08-15T14:35:58.000+00:00"", ""state_primary"": ""Illinois"", ""states_active"": ""Illinois"", ""supervisor_id"": ""a1GRP000002CkQv2AK"", ""total_capacity"": 5.0, ""employment_type"": ""W2 Hourly"", ""ethnicity_other"": null, ""supervisor_name"": ""Ashley Cherry"", ""supervisor_type"": ""Clinician"", ""_fivetran_synced"": ""2025-11-06T18:58:43.118+00:00"", ""_fivetran_deleted"": false, ""salesforce_user_id"": ""005RP000006BDXxYAO"", ""sexual_orientation"": ""Bisexual"", ""health_plans_active"": null, ""oasis_migration_flag"": true, ""capacity_total_kaiser"": 0.0, ""salesforce_account_id"": ""001RP00000HriE1YAJ"", ""supervisor_account_id"": ""0014W00002xHXZNQA4"", ""capacity_filled_kaiser"": 0.0, ""health_plan_ids_active"": null, ""associate_supervisor_id"": null, ""capacity_total_daybreak"": 5.0, ""salesforce_clinician_id"": ""a1GRP000003jTYn2AM"", ""capacity_available_total"": 5.0, ""capacity_filled_daybreak"": 0.0, ""clinical_programs_active"": ""School Sponsored, Self Pay"", ""sexual_orientation_other"": null, ""associate_supervisor_name"": null, ""capacity_available_kaiser"": 0.0, ""capacity_available_daybreak"": 5.0, ""associate_supervisor_account_id"": null}",[],2025-08-13T22:14:25.532754,2025-11-07T20:13:30.682040,,false,2025-11-07 20:37:57.01 UTC,0,2,5,[],5,0,1,[],"[""Black or African American / African Descendant""]",[],2,2,,,0,5,0,"[""Unaffiliated""]",0,IL,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
